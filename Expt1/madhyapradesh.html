<p>Madhya Pradesh (MP) is a state in central India. Its
capital is Bhopal, and the largest city is Indore. <br>Nicknamed the
"heart of India" due to its geographical location in India,<b>
Madhya Pradesh is the second largest state in the country by
area.</b> With over 75 million inhabitants, it is the sixth largest
state in India by population. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh
to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to the
south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest. The
area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area
of the ancient Avanti mahajanapada, whose capital Ujjain (also
known as Avanti) arose as a major city during the second wave of
Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. </p></center>
