<p>Jammu and Kashmir is a state of India. It is located mostly in the Himalayan mountains and shares a border with the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south.<br> Jammu and Kashmir has an international border with the People's Republic of China in the north and east while Line of Control separates it from Pakistani controlled territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgitâ€“Baltistan in the west and northwest respectively. <br>Formerly a part of the erstwhile Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu, which governed the larger historic region of Kashmir, this territory is disputed among China, India and Pakistan. Pakistan, which claims the territory as disputed,[1] refers to it alternatively as Indian-occupied Kashmir or Indian-held Kashmir, while some international agencies such as the United Nations call it Indian-administered Kashmir. <br>The regions under the control of Pakistan are referred to as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or PoK within India, as "Azad" Jammu and Kashmir in Pakistan, and as Pakistan-administered Kashmir or Pakistan-controlled Kashmir generally. <b>Jammu and Kashmir consists of three regions: Jammu, the Kashmir valley and Ladakh.</b> <br>Srinagar is the summer capital, and Jammu is the winter capital. Ladakh, also known as "Little Tibet", is renowned for its remote mountain beauty and Buddhist culture.</p>
